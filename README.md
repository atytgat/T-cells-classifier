# cell-classifier

Used an ensemble learning approach to distinguish between T-helper and T-regulatory cells, known to be hard to differentiate. The dataset used consisted of 1.000 samples for which there were >23.000 features, and a 9-to-1 classes imbalance. Dimensionality reduction techniques were used to improve the generalization performances, and the SMOTE method was applied to balance the classes.
